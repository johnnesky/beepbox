This is the source code for BeepBox, an online tool for sketching and sharing 
chiptune melodies. All of the source code here is available under the MIT 
license. 

Use this code to play songs in your game that were designed in the BeepBox 
editor. These songs are much smaller in file size than equivalent MP3s, at 
the cost of the processing time required to generate the song in code.
